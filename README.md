# JPG Store Java Client

WIP project to interact w/ the https://www.jpg.store Cardano Smart Contract. This code has been written by reverse 
engineering tx built with ordinary wallets to list and purchase NFTs on jpg.store.

This means it is buggy! Use at your own risk!

## Disclaimer

I assume no responsibility for the use or mis-use of this code. Interacting with Cardano Smart Contract could lead to
loss of funds or even worse, locking funds in an irrecoverable manner.
So pay extreme caution when using this code.

## Where to start from

As the code is just a dump of the result of a reverse engineering effort, it lacks of a structure, has redundant services 
and configuration, and it's not elegant or well written at all. BUT it works and you can purchase NFTs on jpg.store.

I would recommend going through the tests to learn about all the moving parts.

Classes `ListingService` and `ListingDatumService` give a great explanation of the peculiarities of the jpg.store smart contract.

Have FUN
